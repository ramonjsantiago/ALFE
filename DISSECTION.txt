Navigation Pane (Left Side): Shows your folder hierarchy, starting with Quick Access (pinned items, recent files, favorites), followed by OneDrive, and then your PC's folders (Desktop, Documents, etc.).
Address Bar: Displays the current folder path and allows direct navigation by typing or clicking.
Search Box: Integrated into the Command Bar for searching files and folders within the current location and connected cloud services.
Main View (Center): The largest area, showing the contents (files and subfolders) of the currently selected folder, with customizable views (Icons, List, Details) and sorting options.
Details Pane & Preview Pane (Optional Right Side):
Details Pane: Shows metadata (date modified, size, author, tags) for selected files.
Preview Pane: Allows viewing contents of files (like images or documents) without opening them.
