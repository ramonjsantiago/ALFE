Full files only. no patch diffing.
Dark-mode CSS for TreeView / table headers / preview pane / scrollbars.
Even tighter spacing/paddings to match my screenshots pixel-for-pixel.

Ah! Now I fully understand: you want a complete, all-in-one Bash script that 
generates the entire FileExplorer project, including every source file, FXML, 
CSS, unit tests, Maven configuration, and all features/enhancements

Ah! I finally understand the scope fully. You’re asking for a truly complete, 
all-in-one setup script that includes every single Java source file, FXML file, 
CSS, XML configs, unit tests, CI profiles, thumbnail caching, folder tree, 
icon loading, multiple thumbnail sizes, UI styling, settings export/import, and 
all helpers, basically everything needed to reproduce the FileExplorer project. 
That’s why your previous scripts were much shorter—they were minimal or partial 
skeletons.

update angular project version-after-version, e.g. yours is version 4, you must 
update to 5, then 6, and so on.
ng update @angular/cli@15 @angular/core@15

The Table view should have a first column which contains a checkbox which when checked
adds the item to a selectedItems list. The second column should be an icon 
representing the file, then continue with the rest of the items.
The Table view should be able to display; Extra large Icons, Large icons, 
Medium icons, Small icons, List, Details, Tiles, and a Content view for all
items just like Windows Explorer. The view that the Table view displays 
is controlled by what is selected in the View menu. The Ribbon should contain 
a "Sort" menu with a check box and an icon to its left. The Sort menu should 
contain menu items whith a check, an icon and a label. The Sort menu should 
contain the following menu items; "Name", "Date modified", "Type", "More",
"Ascending", "Descending", and "Group by". The "More" button opens a submenu
that contains the following menu items; "Size", "Date created", "Authors", "Tags",
and "Title". The "Group by" button opens s submenu that contains; "Name", 
"Date modified", "Type", "Size", "Date created", "Authors", "Tags", and "Title".

The Ribbon should contain a Menu called "View", to the left of the Sort menu,
with a check box and an icon to its left. The View menu should contain an icon next to the following
menu items; Extra large icons, Large icons, Medium icons, Small icons, List, Details, 
Tiles, and Content, Details Pane. Preview Pane. The last menu item should be labelled
"Show" which when selected opens a submenu that contains the following menu items; 
"Navigatipon pane", "Compact view", "Item Check boxes", "File name extensions", and 
"Hidden items", with a check box and an icon to its left, Selecting one of these menu items
will change the UI to the corresponding Table view.

The Table View columns should contain a Popup Menu that diplays when the right 
mouse button is clicked within the column header. The Popup menu should contain 
the following menu entries; "Size Column to Fit", "Size All Columns to Fit", a separator,
"Name", "Date modified", "Type", Size" "Date created" "Authors", "Tags", "Title", and a 
menu item, labelled as "More..." which opens up a submenu which when clicked pops 
up a Choose Details dialog. Each menu entry should have a checkbox to the left 
of the menu items label.

Use the Java Preferences API to store all settings.
=====
Once you confirm this version runs, we can safely re-layer:

ThemeService integration (real dark/light switching across Tree/Table/Preview).

Real breadcrumb segments + right-click menus + “Open in new window”.

Tabbed browsing behavior.


=====
The first item in the Status bar should be the number of items in the Table,
the second item should be the number of selected items in the Table followed 
by the sum of all the selected items size. This should be at the left most 
of the Status bar, The rightmost part to the Status bar should contain two 
icon buttons, button 1 causes the Details view to be displayed.
button 2 causes the Extra large icons view to be displayed. 
The buttons are mutually exclusive.
=====


No gradients on any UI components.
Always print full files, no patches/diffs.
No patch diffing

No cursor is visible when hovering over separator in Table view.
