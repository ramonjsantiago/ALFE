1. Sanity-check the current build (quick verification)

Just to confirm we are on solid ground:

Start the app with the updated MainLayout.fxml.

Verify:

No FXML / CSS warnings or exceptions during startup. Yes.
Folder tree navigation works (clicking folders reloads the right pane). 
No. The folder tree is now full of garbage entries. (see image)
Breadcrumb segments are clickable and navigate correctly. Appears that is correct.
“Details” and “Large icons” toggles swap between table and tile views. Yes.
Dark/light theme look flat with no gradients. No. Gradients are back on buttons. Why so many repeatedly incorrect answers with gradients? We've looped over this problem obver 50 times?

If anything in that list breaks, we fix that first.

2. Unify selection + status bar between Details and Large icons ← recommended next
Right now:
The table selection drives the status bar and most of the logic.
The tile view (Large icons) shows content and opens files, but:
Tile clicks do not update a central “selection” model.
Status bar counts only table selection.
Switching between views does not carry selection across.

Recommended next step:
Introduce a small, shared selection model in MainController so that:
Clicking a tile selects that FileItem (and can support multi-select later).
The status bar always reflects selection from the active view.
When you switch from Large icons → Details, the table selection mirrors the tile selection (and vice versa).
Once that is done, both layouts will “feel” like two faces of the same view rather than separate widgets.
If you want, I can implement this next and provide full updated versions of:

MainController.java
CSS tweaks (if needed for selection styling in tiles)

3. Add a true “Content” layout variant (second tile style)
After selection is unified, the next clean cut of work is to split the large-icon layout into two presets:
Tiles: 48–64 px icon + name + a single line of metadata.
Content: 48–64 px icon + name plus 2–3 lines of rich details (type, size, modified).

This would involve:
Adding another toggle or menu choice (e.g., in the View menu).
Styling a second tile template (maybe via another CSS class like icon-tile-content).
Using the same FlowPane, but choosing which tile template to instantiate based on the active layout.

4. After that: per-folder view/sort preferences
Once both Tiles and Content behave well, a natural follow-up is:
Remember per-folder:
Layout (Details / Tiles / Content).
Sort column and sort direction.
Apply remembered layout when you navigate back to a folder.
